## History
This project was previously up on SourceForge where it has been forgotten about. 

## Be warned
Currently the state of this code is unclear and probably wont run as expected on a moder PHP server.

## Installation
If things still work as expected then it should be possible to:
 - put this code somewhere a browser can see it 
 - navigate to the install/justReasonInstaller.php 
 - follow the configuration steps
 
## To do
 - asses the state of the code and determine what is required to get it up and running
 - modernize the code 
 - switch the css to be created with Less or something similar
 - remove the PEAR dependencies and switch over to npm modules
